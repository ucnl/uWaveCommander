## How to use Î¼WaveCommander

### 1. Connecting your modem to a PC

You will need a **UART-USB** converter, that can work with 3.3V UART. Here is diagrams for soldering:  
Before connecting to a PC, make sure that **CMD** wire is connected to **GND**

After connecting to your PC, you have to connect **CMD** wire to logic one (3.3 or 5 V) to enable [command mode](https://docs.unavlab.com/documentation/EN/uWAVE/uWAVE_Family_en.html#32-command-mode) in your modem:

### 3. Testing built-in sensors

You can see real-time plots of readings of built-in sensors - pressure, depth, temperature, voltage etc.
To enable the feature:

#### 1. Go to tab **Local Sensors** and check following buttons: **P, mBar**, **ðŸŒ¡, Â°C**, **ðŸ¡‡, m** and **âš¡, V**.
#### 2. Select **1_SEC** in the **Update period, msec** combobox

- send data packets with guaranteed delivery
- received data packets
